# Brain Tumor Segmentation using SegFormer

This is a beginner-friendly project that applies the SegFormer architecture to segment brain tumors from MRI images. The dataset used is a simplified version of the BraTS dataset.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample MRI images and masks
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanation
- `scripts/`: Training and inference scripts
- `models/`: Saved model checkpoints
- `results/`: Sample outputs and visualizations

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open the notebook in the `notebooks` folder to walk through the project step-by-step.

## Acknowledgements

Inspired by the NVIDIA SegFormer paper and the BraTS dataset.

*This project is built to showcase basic understanding and beginner-level implementation.*
